               Yes, I'm right in the middle of receiving a holy vision! See that bright light in the top left corner
            of the painting? That's a seraph (or a kind of angel) carrying an image of Christ's crucifixion. It's a big
            deal, I know. How do I appear to be taking it? How would you describe my body language, posture, or facial
            expression?
