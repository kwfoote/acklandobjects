               Yeah, you're right. I'm called a study because Johnson painted me in preparation to make a larger,
                more finished painting. He probably painted me outside, in front of this scene. He made at least
                thirteen other studies of cranberry picking. Here, he was probably most interested in capturing the
                composition and the play of light and shadow over the landscape. for instance, how the standing
                figures cast long shadows on the ground. As you look at other artworks in this gallery, think about
                what the artist is emphasizing. Is it the story? Its setting? Its use of line and color?
