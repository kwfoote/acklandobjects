                Wow. Good eye. The artist who made me, George Segal, is best known for sculptures of figures made of
            plaster. He thought up a scene or scenario, selected a model and pose, then made the sculpture by
            applying bandages soaked in plaster to their bodies, sometimes overtop their clothes. He made me in 1958,
            just as he was transitioning from painting to sculptural work. Segal was interested in the body language
            and expressiveness of his subjects, and their relationship to their surroundings. How would you describe
            my body language? What appears to be my mood?
