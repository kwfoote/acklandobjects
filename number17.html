               Hi! Don't skip me just because I'm small. Just get a little bit closer and look at me carefully.
            I'm a painting made by an American artist named Eastman Johnson around 1875. You might have noticed that I
            am a landscape, but also contain people. What do you notice about the people? Describe how they are painted
            and what they are doing.
